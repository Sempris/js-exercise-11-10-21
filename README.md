Fruit Smoothie. (Problem solving)

Create a class Smoothie and do the following:

- Create a constructor property called ingredients.
- Create a getCost method which calculates the total cost of the ingredients used to make the smoothie.
- Create a getPrice method which returns the number from getCost plus the number from getCost multiplied by 1.5. Round to two decimal places.
- Create a getName method which gets the ingredients and puts them in alphabetical order into a nice descriptive sentence.

If there are multiple ingredients, add the word "Fusion" to the end but otherwise, add "Smoothie".
Remember to change "-berries" to "-berry". See the examples below.

Ingredient	    Price
Strawberries	  $1.50
Banana	        $0.50
Mango	          $2.50
Blueberries	    $1.00
Raspberries	    $1.00
Apple	          $1.75
Pineapple	      $3.50
